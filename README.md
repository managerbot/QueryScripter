# QueryScripter
Welcome to the official QueryScripter GitHub repository!

# Written in JavaScript
QueryScripter is written in JavaScript and therefore is incredibly easy to edit. You can change a wide variety of things, from code to the webpages used to test QueryScripter out - heck, you can even change the symbol used to mark where a query starts if you want to, the possibilities really are endless!

# Open-source
QueryScripter is open-source, meaning anyone can get in on the development fun!

As said before, you can add, delete and edit just about anything here, so come on in and have some fun!
